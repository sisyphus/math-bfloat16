=head1 NAME

 Math::Bfloat16 - perl interface to the __bf16 floating point type.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

 This module needs the MPFR and GMP C libraries. (Install the
 GMP library first as it is a pre-requisite for MPFR.)

 The GMP library is available from https://gmplib.org .
 The MPFR library is available from https://www.mpfr.org .

=head1 DESCRIPTION

 Perform __bf16 (brain float) arithmetic  in perl.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 Values can be assigned either as an IV (42), a PV ("1.414164"), an
 NV (1.414164), a Math::MPFR object (Math::MPFR->new("1.414164")),
 a Math::GMPq object (Math::GMPq->new("1.414164')) or a Math::GMPf
 object (Math::GMPf->new("1.414164")).
 And the values held within a Math::Bfloat16 object can be
 interpolated by double-quoting the object :

 my $val = '1.41416';
 my $obj = Math::Bfloat16->new($val);
 print "$obj\n"; # prints 1.414.

 All input values are effectively cast to a __bf16 value, rounded
 to nearest, with ties to even.

 NOTE !!!!!!! :
  If you want to assign a specific value (eg 1.96500000000000014e2)
  it is better to assign it as a PV. It will then be rounded only
  once to a __bf16. If you first assign that value to something else
  (eg an NV), and then assign it to a Math::Bfloat16 object, the
  value can be rounded twice. In the following example the value is
  firstly rounded to an NV, and secondly from the NV to the 8-bit
  precision Math::Bfloat16 object. EXAMPLE (assuming that the NV
  is of type 'double'):

   my $pv = '1.96500000000000014e2';
   my $nv =  1.96500000000000014e2 ;
   print Math::Bfloat16->new($pv); # 1.97e2 (rounded only once)
   print Math::Bfloat16->new($nv); # 1.96e2 (rounded twice)

  Mostly it won't matter, but we see here that it sometimes can.

 The __bf16 has only 8 bits of precision.
 Maximum finite value is 3.39e38.
 Minimum positive non-zero value is 9.184-41.

=head1 ASSIGNMENT FUNCTIONS

    $obj = Math::Bfloat16->new($[val]);
    $obj = Math::Bfloat16::new([$val]);
     Set $obj to a Math::Bfloat16 object with value $val.
     If $val is not provided, the $obj has the value NaN.
     $val cab be an IV (integer), an NV (perl float), a PV (string),
     a Math::Bfloat16 object, a Math::MPFR object, a Math::GMPf
     object or a Math::GMPq object.
     See the SYNOPSIS section (above) for some elaboration,
     If necessay, $val will be rounded (to nearest, ties to even)
     to fit into the __bf16 type.

    bf16_set($obj, $val);
     Set the value of $obj to the value specified by $val (rounded
     to nearest, ties to even if necessary.)
     $val can be any one of the types that new() accepts.

    bf16_set_nan($obj);
     Se the value of $obj to NaN.

    bf16_set_inf($obj, $iv);
     If $iv is greater than or equal to 0, then set $obj to +Inf.
     Else set $obj to -Inf.

    bf16_set_zero($obj, $iv);
     If $iv is greater than or equal to 0, then set $obj to 0.
     Else set $obj to -0.

=head1 ARITHMETIC

 All arithmetic is done via the overloading of the
 '+', '-', '*', '/', '%', '**'/, '+=', '-=', '*=', '/=', '%=',
 and '**=' operators.
 The '%' and '%=' overloading calls the fmod function.

 The 'log', 'exp', 'sqrt', 'abs' and 'int' functions are also
 overloaded.

=head1 COMPARISON

 The following comparison operators are also overloaded :
 '==', '!=', '>', '>=', '<', '<=' and '<=>'

 Also, the following boolean operations:
  '!' and 'bool'

=head1 OUTPUT FUNCTIONS

    $string = "$obj";
     Set $str to the value of $obj in decimal scientific
     notation (eg 1.234e-2). If this string is passed as
     the argument to Math::Bfloat16->new(), then the
     returned object will hold the identical value to the
     object from which the string was retrieved.  That is,
     the condition:
       (Math::Bfloat16->new("$obj") == $obj)
     will always be true (unless $obj is NaN, of course).

    print $obj;
    print "$obj";
     Either form will display the string returned by the
     interpolating of $obj.

   $string = unpack_bf16_hex($obj);
    Unpack the __bf16 encoding of the value held by $obj as a string
    of hex characters.
    For example, unpack 0, denorm min and +Inf:
      print unpack_bf16_hex(Math::Bfloat16->new(0));         # 0000
      print unpack_bf16_hex(Math::Bfloat16->new('-0'));      # 8000
      print unpack_bf16_hex(Math::Bfloat16->new(2) ** -133); # 0001
      print unpack_bf16_hex(Math::Bfloat16->new(2) ** 128);  # 7F80 (+inf)

=head1 MISCELLANEOUS FUNCTIONS

    $iv = is_bf16_nan($obj);
     Return 1 if the object holds a NaN. Else return 0.

    $iv = is_bf16_inf($obj);
     Return 1 if the object holds a +Inf.
     Return -1 if the object holds a -Inf.
     Otherwise return 0.

    $iv = is_bf16_zero($obj);
     Return 1 if the object holds a zero that is not -0.
     Return -1 if the object holds a -0.
     Otherwise return 0.

   $nv = bf16_to_NV($obj);
    Return the value of $obj as an NV.
    $nv then holds exactly the same value as $obj.

   $MPFR_OBJECT = bf16_to_MPFR($obj);
    Return the value of $obj as an 8-bit precision Math::MPFR object.
    This Math::MPFR object holds exactly the same value as $obj.
    This is the function that the overloading of interpolation calls.
    The instructions "print $obj;" and "print bf16_to_MPFR($obj);"
    will therefore produce exactly the same output.

   bf16_nextabove($obj);
    Increments the value in $obj by the smallest possible positive,
    non-zero amount.

   bf16_nextbelow($obj);
    Decrements the value in $obj by the smallest possible positive,
    non-zero amount.
